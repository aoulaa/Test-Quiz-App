# Test-Quiz-App
To start the project run yarn install and copy .env.example as .env
then run yarn start.


In this project I used css framework bulma and react.

I used React hooks and my custom hooks to organize the logic inside components.

There are some bugs with fetching which should be resolved.

And also if skeletons are used instead of loaders user experience would be better and some other features should be added.
